This repository contains the source code for my personal website, which is a static website built with Next.js. The website is hosted on Vercel and is deployed using Next.js.

I mostly kept this public just so people can see how I made this, but really it is quite simple. The projects and blog posts are simply rendering markdown files that I put into the public folder. Most components and styling are ShadCN/Tailwind. 

If you have any questions or want to chat, feel free to dm me on twitter :)
