# C++ Chess Engine with AI Integration

## Project Overview
Developing a robust chess engine from the ground up using C++, with a focus on efficient state management and bitboard operations for optimal performance. This project aims to combine traditional chess programming techniques with modern AI approaches.


You can find the project on my github [here](https://github.com/KamdynS/chess_engine_from_scratch)!


## Key Features
- Core chess logic implementation
- Efficient move generation and board representation
- Game state evaluation using bitwise operations
- Planned AI integration inspired by AlphaZero
- Modular and extensible codebase design

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++
- **AI Techniques**: Deep Learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (planned)
- **Development Practices**: Object-Oriented Design, Modern C++ Features

## Technical Highlights
- Implemented efficient state management and bitboard operations for optimal performance
- Utilized advanced C++ features for core chess logic, including move generation and board representation
- Planned integration of AI capabilities combining deep learning with Monte Carlo tree search
- Applied object-oriented design principles and modern C++ practices for a modular, extensible codebase
- Enhanced C++ proficiency through hands-on experience with pointers, memory management, and game development-specific optimization techniques
